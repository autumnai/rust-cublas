rust-cuBLAS provides a safe wrapper for [CUDA's cuBLAS][cublas] library, so you
can use cuBLAS comfortably and safely in your Rust application.

As cuBLAS currently relies on CUDA to allocate memory on the GPU, you might also
look into [rust-cuda][rust-cuda].

rust-cublas was developed at [Autumn][autumn] for the Rust Machine Intelligence
Framework [Leaf][leaf].

rust-cublas is part of the High-Performance Computation Framework [Collenchyma][collenchyma], for the
[BLAS Plugin][plugin]. For an easy, unified interface for BLAS operations, such as those provided by
cuBLAS, you might check out [Collenchyma][collenchyma].

For more information,

* see rust-cuBLAS's [Documentation](http://autumnai.github.io/rust-cublas)

## Getting Started

If you're using Cargo, just add rust-cuBLAS to your Cargo.toml:

    [dependencies]
    cublas = "0.2.0"

If you're using [Cargo Edit][cargo-edit], you can call:

    $ cargo add cublas

## Building

rust-cublas depends on the cuBLAS runtime libraries,
which can be obtained from [NVIDIA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cublas).

### Manual Configuration

rust-cublas's build script will by default attempt to locate `cublas` via pkg-config.
This will not work in some situations, for example,
* on systems that don't have pkg-config,
* when cross compiling, or
* when cuBLAS is not installed in the default system library directory (e.g. `/usr/lib`).

Therefore the build script can be configured by exporting the following environment variables:

* `CUBLAS_LIB_DIR`<br/>
If specified, a directory that will be used to find cuBLAS runtime libraries.
e.g. `/opt/cuda/lib`

* `CUBLAS_STATIC`<br/>
If specified, cuBLAS libraries will be statically rather than dynamically linked.

* `CUBLAS_LIBS`<br/>
If specified, will be used to find cuBLAS libraries under a different name.

If either `CUBLAS_LIB_DIR` or `CUBLAS_INCLUDE_DIR` are specified, then the build script will skip the pkg-config step.

If your also need to run the compiled binaries yourself, make sure that they are available:
```sh
# Linux; for other platforms consult the instructions that come with cuBLAS
cd <cublas_installpath>
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

## Changelog

You can find the release history in the root file [CHANGELOG.md][changelog].

A changelog is a log or record of all the changes made to a project, such as a website or software project, usually including such records as bug fixes, new features, etc. - [Wikipedia][changelog-quote]

We are using [Clog][clog], the Rust tool for auto-generating CHANGELOG files.
